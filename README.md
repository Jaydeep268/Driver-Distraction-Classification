# Driver-Distraction-Classification
In this data you are given driver images, each taken in a car with a driver doing something in the car (texting, eating, talking on the phone, makeup, reaching behind, etc).

You need to classify images into these 10 classes-->

c0: safe driving

c1: texting - right

c2: talking on the phone - right

c3: texting - left

c4: talking on the phone - left

c5: operating the radio

c6: drinking

c7: reaching behind

c8: hair and makeup

c9: talking to passenger


Your goal is to predict the likelihood of what the driver is doing in each picture.
